quilte
------
- lightweight Qt terminal emulator
- (but probably a bit heavier than pangoterm)
- search buffer
- unicode
- save buffer
- tabs
- configurable

qvtermwidget
------------
- standalone terminal emulator widget
- based on LeoNerd's vterm project https://launchpad.net/libvterm/

current state
-------------
- functional and useful
- qvtermwidget code is a mess though
- supports (very basic) embedded Hebrew RTL
- supports input method entry

planned improvements
--------------------
- hide/show toolbars
- right-click displays menu bar
- enable hiding of menu bar and tab titles
- why doesn't vim change the title? it does in pangoterm
- why doesn't ctrl-L clear the terminal
- better RTL support
- background transparency in composited environments
- profiles
